# todo-menu
This is a todo list app made using gtk/gtkmm-4.0.
This is simply a learning project and isn't for serious use.
Currently todo supports basic i/o, but formatting and features for an actual todo menu is missing, e.g the ability to check a goal.

## Dependencies
[gtk4](https://www.gtk.org/docs/installations/index) and [gtkmm-4.0](https://gtkmm.org/en/download.html).

## How to build
simply type within the directory:
```
make
```

## Miscellaneous
To clean up your directory of any object files, type:
```
make clean
```
